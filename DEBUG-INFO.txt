HOMEPAGE TEMPLATE DEBUG INFO
=============================

What to check if design doesn't match:

1. CHECK TEMPLATE SELECTION
   - Go to: Pages → Edit your page
   - Right sidebar: Page Attributes → Template
   - Must say: "Homepage"
   - If it says "Default Template", that's the problem!

2. CHECK IF CSS IS LOADING
   - Press F12 on your page
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
   - Look for these files:
     ✅ tailwind.min.css (should be 200 status)
     ✅ homepage.css (should be 200 status)

   If you see 404 errors, CSS isn't loading!

3. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for red errors
   - Common issues:
     - "Failed to load resource" = file path wrong
     - "CORS error" = CDN blocked
     - No errors but no styling = cache issue

4. CHECK HTML STRUCTURE
   - Press F12
   - Go to Elements/Inspector tab
   - Find: <section class="hero-section">
   - It should have:
     <div class="hero-wrapper">
       <img class="hero-image">
       <div class="hero-overlay">
         <div class="hero-content">
           <h1 class="hero-title">
           etc...

5. HARD REFRESH
   - Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   - This clears cached CSS

6. CLEAR WORDPRESS CACHE
   - If using WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, etc.
   - Go to plugin settings
   - Click "Clear Cache"

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Hero section: Full width, 500px height (600px on desktop)
- Hero image: Covers full section
- Dark overlay over image
- White text centered
- Two buttons (white solid + white outline)
- Categories: 2 columns mobile, 4 columns desktop
- Category cards: Square with hover zoom effect
- Featured products: Gray background section

IF YOU SEE:
- Just text and images with no styling → CSS not loading
- Some styling but wrong layout → Tailwind conflicts
- Everything tiny/squished → Container classes not working
- Images huge and text ugly → CSS definitely not loading

QUICK FIX CHECKLIST:
□ Template selected as "Homepage"
□ Hard refreshed browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
□ Cleared WordPress cache
□ Checked F12 console for errors
□ Verified homepage.css is loading in Network tab

STILL NOT WORKING?
Share a screenshot of:
1. The page (what you see)
2. F12 → Console tab (any errors)
3. F12 → Network tab (show CSS files)
4. Page edit screen → Page Attributes section
